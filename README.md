# Rapid Fire

Rapid Fire - Copying live data on IBM i

## Description

Do you have files with millions or even billions of records? Imagine you have to change such a file e.g. a new field has to be added. Maybe your system is really fast and you have the time to install that change at the weekend. But what to do if your shop must be available almost 24/7? In this case it is required to reduce the downtime as much as possible.

That is where Rapid Fire comes in play. Rapid Fire reduces the downtime of your system to a minimum. Instead of shutting down the system for hours or even days you will be offline for a couple of minutes.
