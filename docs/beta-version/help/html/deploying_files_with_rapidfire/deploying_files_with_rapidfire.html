Rapid Fire let you deploy your changes while your users are busy. It performs the
following steps in order to change a production file:
<ul>
<li>Create a shadow library to store the new file.</li>
<li>Create the new file in the shadow library.</li>
<li>Generate a RPG program for copying the data from the production to the shadow library.</li>
<li>Start journaling for the original file in the production library.</li>
<li>Copy data from the production to the shadow library using a batch job. Your users keep on working and do not have to leave the application.</li>
<li>While the copy job is active, a second Rapid Fire batch job receives changes of the copied data from the journal.</li>
<li>When all records a copied, the changes are applied to the data in the shadow library.</li>
</ul>
When Rapid Fire starts applying the changes from the journal, you reached the point when you
can ask your users to leave the application in order to install the new file. That takes just
a few minutes, since all you have to do is moving some objects: 
<ul>
<li>Ensure that nobody can change the production file any longer.</li>
<li>End the Rapid Fire copy job.</li>
<li>Move the old file from the production library to a backup library.</li>
<li>Move the new file from the shadow to the production library.</li>
</ul>
