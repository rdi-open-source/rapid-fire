		                   Rapid Fire uses commitment control to update its files. Therefore a journal 
		                   must be attached to all Rapid Fire files. By default the Rapid Fire installer
		                   ensures that journaling is started for all Rapid Fire files.<br>
		                   But in case that you have installed a high availability software, such as 
		                   BUS/400, MIMIX or iTERA, that also use journals to keep track of object changes, 
		                   you may need to install Rapid Fire without a journal, because that is attached 
		                   by your HA software.<br><br>
		                   <font color="red">Please uncheck "Start journaling Rapid Fire files" on the 
		                   "Transfer Rapid Fire Library" dialog to transfer the Rapid Fire library 
		                   without attaching a journal to the Rapid Fire files.</font></td>

		                   The Rapid Fire plug-in is a client-server application that utilizes
		                   SQL stored procedures and functions for retrieving data from the host
		                   and for executing actions on the host. All SQL procedures and functions
		                   are installed with the specific schema name that equals the name of the
		                   Rapid Fire product library. The default name is <i>RAPIDFIRE</i>.<p>
		                   The library is shipped with program CRTDRPSQL that can be used for
		                   deleting and/or creating the procedures and functions.<p>
		                   The procedures and functions are created automatically by the installer,
		                   when you use the "Transfer Rapid Fire library" dialog for installing
		                   the library.<p>
		                   Please consider reading <a href="../uninstall/uninstall_library.html">Uninstall Rapid Fire Library</a>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Start WDSCi 7.0 or RDi 9.5.1.3+.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Windows / Preferences&quot;.</li>
<li>Expand item &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;.</li>

    RAPIDFIRE.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> You may use another library name, but be aware
    that this library will be <b>deleted</b> if it exists.
<li>Verify the ASP group. The name of the ASP group is used for parameter <i>RSTASPDEV</i>
    of command <i>RSTLIB</i> when restoring the Rapid Fire library. The possible values are:<p>
    <table>
    <tr><td nowrap valign="top">*NONE</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">The DLTLIB and RSTLIB commands are executed without the ASPDEV and RSTASPDEV parameters.</td></tr>
    <tr><td nowrap valign="top">asp-device-name</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">The DLTLIB command is executed with ASPDEV(*) and the RSTLIB command is extended with RSTASPDEV(asp-device-name).</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    </li>

<p>
<div class="codeIndent">SELECT * FROM QSYS2.SYSFUNCS WHERE SPECIFIC_SCHEMA = '<i>libraryName</i>'</div>
<p>
Replace <i>libraryName</i> with the name of your Rapid Fire product library.
