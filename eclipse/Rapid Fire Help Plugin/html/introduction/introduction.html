The Rapid Fire Open Source Project delivers a high quality and reliable solution for copying
data while production is active.
<p>
Do you have files with millions or even billions of records? Imagine you have to change 
such a file e.g. a new field has to be added. Possibly you have the time to install this 
change at the weekend. But what if your shop works 24 hours a day and 7 days a week? In 
this case it is absolutely necessary to reduce the time needed for the installation to 
avoid a long shutdown of the system.

<p>
This is the point Rapid Fire comes in. With Rapid Fire it is possible to reduce the 
downtime of your system to a minimum. Instead of shutting down the system for hours or 
even days you can reduce this with Rapid Fire to minutes.
<p>
Rapid Fire features are driven from our ideas and needs, but everybody is encouraged to contribute 
suggestions and manpower to improve the power of Rapid Fire.
