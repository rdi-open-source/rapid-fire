The Rapid Fire job contains files, which have fields with the SQL GENERATED clause. If you use Rapid Fire for such files, then the
values of the fields with the SQL GENERATED clause will be regenerated for each record in the files. IF YOU CONTINUE, THEN THE
VALUES WILL BE REGENERATED. We advise you to cancel. You can continue if you really understand what this means and if this causes
NO problems in your application. It is your decision. Be warned. The wrong decision can destroy your entire application.
